	    <h4>Veera Sanjana, M.S., M.S.W</h4>
<p align="justify">
Veera Sanjana is a certified Hatha Yoga teacher and a certified Infant Massage (FHFL) instructor. Veera’s unique yoga teaching style stresses a strong fluid practice with emphasis on mind, body, and breath connections to direct our attention inwards. She approaches her yoga practice with gratitude, reverence and love. She considers the body to be a temple and the yoga postures to be the offerings we make to that temple.
</p><p align="justify">
Veera was born in Jamshedpur, India and was schooled in the ancient yoga traditions of India from the age of five.  The early yoga instruction, in addition to teaching basic postures, was mainly to inculcate discipline and respect. She draws from a deep study and understanding of mind-body techniques and healing modalities. 
</p><p align="justify">
One of the first things her Guru told her as she was preparing to conduct her very first yoga class was "Love your Self." She says, "It was such a simple instruction, and like so many spiritual truths, it sounded obvious, almost boring. It turned out to be the key to my practice, because to really love yourself, you need to discover the you that is always, unconditionally, loving. That takes meditation and self-inquiry. In meditation, you let go of your conditioned ideas about yourself, and make space for the true Self, the Heart to come forth. Then love becomes the most basic fact of your existence, rather than something you are always trying to find." 
</p><p align="justify">
Under the guidance of her guru in India and her western guru here, Veera has taught many different types of yoga, including gentle yoga, prenatal, postnatal, restorative, yin yoga, yoga for kids, yoga for seniors, therapeutic yoga, meditation, and ayurveda. She has created yoga classes, courses and training in meditation and spiritual wisdom, herb and ayurvedic cooking classes and ayurvedic spa routines. From her home base in California, she travels often and offers workshops and retreats that integrate meditation, yoga wisdom, ayurveda and spiritual life-skills. 
</p><p align="justify">
A versatile talent, Veera is also well-known in the field of cooking natural, healing foods. She conducts workshops and private consultations on various aspects of natural foods, cooking, herbs and herbal preparations and achieving balance through yoga and meditation, all of which help make health, happiness and vitality a way of life. 
</p><p align="justify">
Veera’s passion and visionary presentations grow out of her extensive experience as a instructor of Yoga, Meditation, Compassionate Touch, Ayurvedic Healing, Nutrition, Eastern Dance Therapy and as a mother. She enjoys teaching classes, seminars and writes for magazines. Veera now lives in East Bay, California where the other loves of her life are her family and fresh floral arrangements.	</div>
